# SQL on Python Practice Repository

This repository contains a Python script that allows you to practice SQL in Python. The script is designed to simulate a crowdfund dashboard that requires users to log in or sign up before accessing the dashboard. The dashboard allows users to view and manage their crowd-fund campaigns.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   `````
   pip install pysqlite3
   ```

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ````
   python app.py
   ````

5. The script will display a welcome message and prompt you to choose an action: login, sign up, or exit.

   - If you choose to log in, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. If the credentials are correct, you will be directed to the dashboard.
   - If you choose to sign up, you will be prompted to enter your details, including username, password, and email address.
   - If you choose to exit, the script will terminate.

6. Once you are on the dashboard, you can view your campaigns and manage them accordingly.
